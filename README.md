For my creative project, I created a web application, that can be accessed here: https://lin101-phonetics.herokuapp.com/

# Description of Resource
This resource is to help students gain familiarity with the IPA characters that we are taught in LIN101. There are three ways that this resource does this:

1) Articulation exercise - in this exercise, students are given an IPA character. They can then be asked to provide the height/backness/rounding for vowels, or the place of articulation, manner of articulation, and voicing for consonants. After they have selected their choices, they are told whether they answered correctly/incorrectly, and will be given the correct answer. This exercise was designed to help students remember the articulatory properties of the IPA characters that we have learned in class. 

This exercise can be accessed from the menu in the navbar at the top, or directly here: https://lin101-phonetics.herokuapp.com/articulation 

2) IPA to English exercise - in this exercise, students are given an IPA transcription of an English word. Students are then given a choice of four possible English words, and must select the correct word that corresponds to the IPA character.  After they have clicked on the word that they think is correct, the website will give them feedback - telling them if they were correct, and providing the correct word if they were incorrect. This exercise was designed to help students memorize what sounds that the IPA characters make and how to apply that knowledge to the English language.

3) Syllabification - in this exercise, students are given an English word and need to identify which of the syllables are stressed. This exercise helps students (especially non-native English speakers) familiarize themselves with stress in the English language.

# References and description of originality
My resource is entirely original. The data for the articulation exercises used Peter Jurgec's Sounds: Their Structure and Patterns in Language. 2nd edition. page 18 for vowels, page 38 for consonants as a reference. (Jurgec 18, 38). The data for the IPA to English, and syllabification exercises was from Peter Jurgec's transcriptions found on Quercus that were based on course content from Schertz as a reference. (Schertz). The English word choices for each of the ~400 words were written manually by me, and I chose the words based on common mix ups that students may have (e.g. confusing j with y, confusing r with turned r, etc.) in order to provide the best learning experience possible. All the data can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZENjvw9t_59e6mMF4T56TxymhkIoIMO6Qt8yLfRSOEY/edit?usp=sharing
